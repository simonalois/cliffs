Abstract: <br>
Mountain forests provide a wide variety of ecosystem services to society. Considering the trend of temperature 
increase and related climatic extremes in the Greater Alpine Area, mountain forests are likely to undergo a 
dramatic change in the next centuries. Therefore, forest managers face the challenge of adapting forests and 
support resilience to climate change. To facilitate this process, the forest gap model ForClim, as a process-based 
forest succession models was applied to generate site-specific information on future forest stand development and species composition. 
The tree species composition without management activities was predicted until 2100 assuming a stable current climate, 
a moderate and a severe climate change scenario represented by RCP 4.5 and 8.5, respectively. Furthermore, three different 
forest stand development scenarios were implemented. The investigated forest stand indicates a significant climate-sensitivity. 
It has been demonstrated that deciduous mixed forest stands are necessary to increase the resilience and adopt managed forests 
to climate change. With active silvicultural measurement, like the assisted migration through planting of thermophilus species, 
negative effects of climate change could be diminished. The presented modelling approach is feasible to assess the impacts of 
climate change and support decision making of local forest managers.
